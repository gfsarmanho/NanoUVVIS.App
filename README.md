# Installation
To use `NanoUV-VIS` in your PC, you will need first to install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) statistical software. We recommend to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) editor, in order to have a better experience with this [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application.

Second, you will need to install the following R packages: `shiny`, `shinyjs`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `shinycssloaders`, `plotly`, `plot3D`, `DT`, `crosstalk` and `htmlwidgets`. To install them from CRAN, use the following R code:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinyjs", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "shinycssloaders", "plotly", "plot3D", "DT", "crosstalk", "htmlwidgets"))
```

After the local installation, you will be ready to run the application! Just type on R/RStudio console:

```r
shiny::runGitHub("gfsarmanho/NanoUV-VIS")
```
If there are no error messages, you are ready to enjoy *NanoUV-VIS*! 

> **NOTE:** Remember not to close R/RStudio after initiate the web application!

# Getting Started
After start the application, you should see the following screen on your web browser:

Click in **About** tab to see an overview of the application, describing the way you should upload your UV-VIS data and the available interactive plots. For more detailed information and description of the tool using a real experiment, please check [Calderon-Jimenez et. al, 2017](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/122/jres.122.037.pdf).

In the following gif you will find some quick instructions to run *NanoUV-VIS* using an example data set.
